# [Advent of Code 2021](https://adventofcode.com/2021) solutions

This year I plan participate in Advent of Code to solve programming puzzles and
will share my solutions in Rust in this repository.

Code and inputs for each day are in the corresponding directory, run the code
for Day 1 (Part 1) with

```bash
$ cargo run --bin day1-1
  Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.00s
    Running `target/debug/day1-1`
This is day 1, part 1!
```
